;;; Comentary:

;; To use this package, put the lisp/ directory from this package in
;; your Emacs load-path and do:
;;
;; (autoload 'xslt-process-mode "xslt-process" "Emacs XSLT processing" t)
;; 
;; If you're using DocBook, you may also want to add this line:
;; 
;; (autoload 'xslt-process-install-docbook "xslt-process"
;;  "Register the DocBook package with XSLT-process" t)
;;
;; Then, while being in an XML buffer, use the XSLT menu to either:
;;
;; - run an XSLT processor on the buffer and display the results in a
;; different one
;;
;; - run an XSLT processor in debug mode, so you can view the XSLT
;; processing as it happens

(defun xslt-process-mode (&optional arg)
  "Minor mode to invoke an XSLT processor on the current buffer.

The XSLT processor can be run either to process the file and show the
results in a different buffer, or it can be run in debug mode. In this
mode you can actually see what the XSLT processor is doing, you can
setup breakpoints, look at local and global variables, essentially all
the operations a debugger can do.

With no argument, this command toggles the xslt-process mode. With a
prefix argument ARG, turn xslt-process minor mode on iff ARG is
positive.

Bindings:

\\[xslt-process-mode]: Toggle the XSLT minor mode on the current buffer.
\\[xslt-process-toggle-debug-mode]: Toggle the debug mode on the current buffer.

\\[xslt-process-invoke-buffer-view]: Invoke the XSLT processor on the
current buffer, and view the results in a buffer.
\\[xslt-process-invoke-browser-view]: Invoke the XSLT processor on the
current buffer, and view the results in a browser.
\\[xslt-process-invoke-pdf-viewer]: Assume the resulting XML document is
an XML FO document. This command runs the Apache FOP processor on it
and displays the result in a PDF reader of choice.
\\[xslt-process-do-run]: Start the XSLT debugger on the current
buffer.

\\[xslt-process-set-breakpoint]: Set a breakpoint at the current line.
\\[xslt-process-delete-breakpoint]: Delete breakpoint at the current line.
\\[xslt-process-enable-disable-breakpoint]: Disable or enable breakpoint.

\\[xslt-process-do-step]: Step into the current element.
\\[xslt-process-do-next]: Step over the current element.
\\[xslt-process-do-finish]: Exit from the current xsl:template.
\\[xslt-process-do-continue]: Continue the XSLT processing until the
next breakpoint, or until the processing ends.
\\[xslt-process-do-stop]: Stop the XSLT processor while it is
running. This may be useful for long processings in which you forgot
to setup breakpoints.
\\[xslt-process-do-quit]: Exit the XSLT processor.

Hooks:
`xslt-process-breakpoint-set-hooks' is run each time a breakpoint is set.
`xslt-process-breakpoint-removed-hooks' is run each time a breakpoint
is removed.
`xslt-process-breakpoint-enabled-disabled-hooks' is run each time a
breakpoint is enabled or disabled.
`xslt-process-source-frames-changed-hooks' is run when the XML
document element path changes.
`xslt-process-style-frames-changed-hooks' is run when the XSLT frames change.
`xslt-process-global-variables-changed-hooks' is run when the global
variables change.
`xslt-process-local-variables-changed-hooks' is run when the local
variables change.
