# XSLT-process

> XSLT-process is a minor mode for XEmacs or GNU Emacs which
> transforms it into a powerful XML editor with XSLT processing and
> debugging capabilities.

You can invoke an XSLT processor of choice on the current XML file
you're editing, and see the results in another buffer. In case of
errors, the error messages generated by the XSLT processor, are shown
in a compilation buffer, which allows you to quickly go to the
location of the error.

You can also run the XSLT processor in debugging mode, and view step
by step what the XSLT processor is doing. You can view the current
stack frame in the XSLT program, the current XML context node being
processed, what are the local and global variables, set breakpoints in
both the XML source file and the XSLT program.

The original project is hosted
on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xslt-process/). Many
thanks to Ovidiu Predescu for the work done.

For more information on the how to setup and use XSLT-process, please
