	* lisp/xslt-speedbar.el: Added some key bindings in the speedbar's
	keymap for the XSLT debugger. Correctly handle showing of the
	style frames in speedbar.

	* lisp/xslt-process.el: Added
	xslt-process-debugger-process-started to indicate whether the XSLT
	debugger process is started or not. Use this variable to change
	the status of the "Quit debugger" menu item.
	
	Added source and style frames stack variables and support for
	them.
	
	Use no buffer for the Emacs process communication with the XSLT
	debugger. Use a filter function to insert into the output
	buffer. This way killing this buffer doesn't affect in any way the
	connection with the debugger process.
	
	Temporarily make the results buffer writable so it can be erased.
	
	Reset the state of the source and style frames, and of the
	xslt-process-debugger-process-started variables when the debugger
	process dies.
	
	Removed unnecessary comments and commented out `message' calls.

	* java/xslt/debugger/saxon/SaxonTraceListener.java: Removed
	printing of debug messages.

	* java/xslt/debugger/cmdline/EmacsObserver.java: Remove the
	superfluous newlines.

	* java/xslt/debugger/StyleFrame.java: Remove the file: URI method
	if present.

	* java/xslt/debugger/SourceFrame.java: Remove the file: URI method
	if present.

2001-04-08  Ovidiu Predescu  <ovidiu@cup.hp.com>

	* lisp/xslt-speedbar.el: Graciously handle setting, deleting,
	enabling, and disabling of breakpoints: they are now updated in
	the speedbar. Added configurable faces for these colors.

	* lisp/xslt-process.el: Added hooks to be invoked when breakpoint
	operations happen, and source and style frames change. Added
	speedbar entry in the XSLT menu. Reimplement
	xslt-process-output-from-process to handle partial output from the
	XSLT debugger process; this still needs more work.

	* java/xslt/debugger/saxon/SaxonTraceListener.java: Send the
	sourceStackChanged and styleStackChanged messages if the
	appropriate stack frames change.

	* java/xslt/debugger/saxon/SaxonStyleFrame.java: Removed the
	localVariables instance variables; use instead the inherited one.

	* java/xslt/debugger/cmdline/EmacsObserver.java: Implemented
	sourceStackChanged and styleStackChanged.

	* java/xslt/debugger/cmdline/Controller.java: Added
	getManager. Added help line for the sbt command.

	* java/xslt/debugger/cmdline/CmdLineObserver.java: Added
	implementations for sourceStackChanged and styleStackChanged
	methods.

	* java/xslt/debugger/StyleFrame.java: Added clone, equals,
	hashCode, getFilename and getLine methods.

	* java/xslt/debugger/SourceFrame.java: Added clone, equals and
	hashCode, getFilename and getLine methods.

	* java/xslt/debugger/Observer.java: Added sourceStackChanged and
	styleStackChanged methods. Documented methods.

	* java/xslt/Xalan1.java: Prefix filename with the file: URI.

	* java/xslt/Saxon.java: Prefix filename with the file: URI.

2001-04-05  Ovidiu Predescu  <ovidiu@cup.hp.com>

	* lisp/xslt-process.el: Removed debug messages.

	* lisp/xslt-process.el: Cleaned up the highlighting code by
	putting the common functionality in a single function.

2001-04-04  Ovidiu Predescu  <ovidiu@cup.hp.com>

	* lisp/xslt-speedbar.el: Got the breakpoints to correctly expand
	and unexpand in the speedbar. Need to implement auto-updating of
	the breakpoints list when the users sets up a new breakpoint, and
	to handle the case when the buffer containing the breakpoint
	disappears.

	* lisp/xslt-process.el: In xslt-process-get-file-buffer open the
	file and return the buffer that holds the file.

2001-04-03  Ovidiu Predescu  <ovidiu@cup.hp.com>

	* lisp/xslt-process.el: Added test code for the speedbar support.

2001-04-02  Ovidiu Predescu  <ovidiu@cup.hp.com>

	* lisp/xslt-process.el: Removed the make-variable-buffer-local
	calls from inside xslt-process-mode. Grouped the functions based
	on how they get invoked.

	* Makefile: Changed the rules for compiling the Java files.

	* java/xslt/debugger/saxon/SaxonTraceListener.java: Print the
	entering and exiting messages followed by a colon to be able to
	match them in Emacs.

	* lisp/xslt-process.el: Create a TCP/IP connection to the XSLT
	debugger process to get the results of the processing separate
	from stdin. Now the XSLT results go in a separate buffer.

	Line indicators to show whether the debugger is entering in or
	exiting from an element. Fixed (most of) the problems when
	toggling back and forth in debug mode and in the xslt-process
	mode.

	* java/xslt/debugger/cmdline/EmacsObserver.java: Added the support
	code for creating the server socket and passing it to the Emacs
	process.

	* java/xslt/debugger/cmdline/Controller.java: Added getDebugger().

2001-04-01  Ovidiu Predescu  <ovidiu@cup.hp.com>

	* lisp/xslt-process.el: Setup keybindings for the stop and quit
	actions.
	
	Correctly handle, by making the minor-mode-alist buffer local,
	different minor mode line strings in distinct buffers.
	
	Added execution-context-error-function as function hook to be
	called when an error message is reported.
	
	Remove the XSLT-process mode from a file, when xslt-process-mode
	is invoked with a negative argument. The menu is correctly removed
	now.
	
	Restarting the XSLT debugger now asks the user. All the step,
	next, continue and finish actions now check for the current state
	of the XSLT debugger before doing anything.
	
	Quit now asks the user whether to delete the breakpoints from the
	source files.
	
	Graciously reset the Emacs' state variables when the XSLT process
	buffer is killed.

	* java/xslt/debugger/saxon/XSLTDebugger.java: Setup the
	StreamResult based on the outStream instance variable. Don't close
	the output stream after the processing is complete.

	* java/xslt/debugger/cmdline/Controller.java: Pass the Controller
	instance in the Observer's constructor.

	* java/xslt/debugger/cmdline/EmacsObserver.java: Implement
	debuggerProcessStarted(). Pass the Controller instance in the
	constructor.

	* java/xslt/debugger/cmdline/CmdLineObserver.java: Implement
	debuggerProcessStarted().

	* java/xslt/debugger/Observer.java: Added debuggerProcessStarted.

	* java/xslt/debugger/AbstractXSLTDebugger.java: Use an output
	stream instead of an output file name. This allows a socket stream
	to be set up for outputting the result of the XSLT processing.

2001-03-30  Ovidiu Predescu  <ovidiu@cup.hp.com>

	* lisp/xslt-process.el: Better handling of menu items enabling and
	disabling. Added initial support for restarting the XSLT debugger
	process. Correctly handle unhighlighting of breakpoints. Print
	notification message when the XSLT processor finishes processing
	or when it encounters an error.

	* java/xslt/debugger/saxon/XSLTDebugger.java: Invoke the observer
	instance to handle errors.

	* java/xslt/debugger/saxon/SaxonTraceListener.java: Comment out
	unnecessary printlns.

	* java/xslt/debugger/cmdline/Controller.java: Removed the code to
	handle the restarting during a processor run. Expect this to
	happen in the front-end code, where there's much more control.

	* java/xslt/debugger/Observer.java: Added processorFinished and
	caughtException.
	* java/xslt/debugger/cmdline/CmdLineObserver.java: Likewise.
	* java/xslt/debugger/cmdline/EmacsObserver.java: Likewise.

	* lisp/xslt-process.el: Start the XSLT debugger in Emacs
	mode. Handle Emacs formatted output from the debugger. Now handles
	step, next and continue operations in an XSLT debug mode
	buffer. Automatically opens debugged files not present in Emacs
	and switch them to the XSLT debug mode.

	* java/xslt/debugger/cmdline/Controller.java: Allow specifying the
	processor to be used and whether notifications should be formatted
	for Emacs.

	* java/xslt/debugger/cmdline/EmacsObserver.java: Prints messages
	formatted such that they contain code that can be executed
	directly by Emacs.

2001-03-28  Ovidiu Predescu  <ovidiu@cup.hp.com>

	* lisp/xslt-process.el: Correctly display the mode
	indicator. Breakpoint related functions reworked.

2001-03-24  Ovidiu Predescu  <ovidiu@cup.hp.com>

	* java/xslt/debugger/saxon/SaxonTraceListener.java: Fixed the next
	operation.

2001-03-22  Ovidiu Predescu  <ovidiu@cup.hp.com>

	* java/xslt/debugger/saxon/SaxonValue.java: Use SaxonType to store
	the type of the value.

	* java/xslt/debugger/saxon/SaxonStyleFrame.java: Fixed typos in
	getGlobalVariables() and getLocalVariables().

	changes in the Java additional classpath and restart BSH if such
	changes occur while it's running.

Thu Feb 15 01:22:23 2001  Ovidiu Predescu  <ovidiu@cup.hp.com>

	* java/xslt/TrAX.java: Added support for cached
	stylesheets. Currently only http: URIs seem to be handled well,
	but file: will follow soon. It looks like the FTP support does not
	work.

Wed Feb  7 19:47:20 2001  Ovidiu Predescu  <ovidiu@cup.hp.com>

	* lisp/xslt-process.el: Renamed Xalan2 to TrAX as the support code
	works with any TrAX processor.
