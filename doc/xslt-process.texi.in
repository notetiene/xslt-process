@chapter What is it?

@emph{XSLT-process} is a minor mode for XEmacs or GNU Emacs which
transforms it into a powerful XML editor with XSLT processing and
debugging capabilities.

You can invoke an XSLT processor of choice on the current XML file
you're editing, and see the results in another buffer. In case of
errors, the error messages generated by the XSLT processor, are shown in
a compilation buffer, which allows you to quickly go to the location of
the error.

You can also run the XSLT processor in debugging mode, and view step by
step what the XSLT processor is doing. You can view the current stack
frame in the XSLT program, the current XML context node being processed,
what are the local and global variables, set breakpoints in both the XML
source file and the XSLT program.

@section Package installation under XEmacs

@emph{XSLT-process} is also released as an XEmacs package, so if you're
an XEmacs user, chances are that the package is already installed with
your XEmacs installation. If it's not installed, try obtaining the
latest XEmacs package from your XEmacs local mirror or from the main
XEmacs ftp site. It may happen that the XEmacs package is a little older
than the currently released version of @emph{XSLT-process}, in which
case you want to follow the steps described below.

You can retrieve the XEmacs package either manually from the ftp site,
or by using the ``Options'' @result{} ``Manage packages''
menu. Follow the instructions described under the ``Options''
@result{} ``Manage packages'' @result{} ``Help'' menu entry if
you're not familiar with this procedure.

@subsection Installing Speedbar

@emph{XSLT-process} depends on another package, @emph{Speedbar}, for
displaying breakpoints, stack frames and global and local variables. You
need to obtain and install this package first, in case you don't have it
already installed.

To verify if you have this package installed, type @kbd{M-x
speedbar-version}; this will give either an error, if the package is not
installed, or the version number of the @emph{speedbar} package if it's
already installed. You should have at least version 0.13 for
@emph{XSLT-process} to work.

In case you don't have the @emph{speedbar} package, you can obtain it
from its @uref{http://cedet.sourceforge.net/speedbar.shtml,Web
site}. Unpack the package in your @kbd{~/emacs} directory. If you don't
have a @kbd{~/emacs} directory, create one now. Then go to the speedbar
directory and run

@example
$ make
@end example

If you're using XEmacs, you need to run:

@example
$ make EMACS=xemacs
@end example

This step byte-compiles all the Lisp files in the @emph{speedbar}
package using your Emacs editor. Please follow Speedbar's installation
document for more up-to-date information on how to compile it.

@subsection Installing @emph{XSLT-process}

To install the @emph{XSLT-process} mode, first obtain the latest stable
version from the SourceForge Web site, at
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/xslt-process/,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xslt-process/}. Unpack the distribution
in your @kbd{~/emacs} directory; this will create the
@kbd{xslt-process-@value{version}} directory in your @kbd{~/emacs}
directory.

You now need to tell Emacs to look for the new package in this newly
created directory. You do this by adding the following lines in the
Emacs configuration file @kbd{~/.emacs} (if you don't have such a file,
create one now):

@example
(mapc (lambda (x)
        (pushnew (expand-file-name x) load-path))
      (list "~/emacs"
            "~/emacs/xslt-process-@value{version}/lisp"
            "~/emacs/speedbar-0.13"))
@end example

You can remove the reference to @kbd{speedbar-0.13} in the lines above,
if you didn't have to install @emph{speedbar} as described in the
previous section (@ref{Installing Speedbar}).

@section Setting up the @emph{XSLT-process} mode

@cindex PSGML
@cindex sgml-mode.el
@cindex xslide
@emph{XSLT-process} is an Emacs minor mode, which means is extending the
functionality of whatever mode you use for editing XML or XSLT files,
instead of creating a similar one.

@emph{XSLT-process} does not try to help in the editing of XML or XSLT
files, it just enables Emacs to process such files. Thus
@emph{XSLT-process} should work with any XML/XSLT editing mode your
Emacs is configured for.

@emph{XSLT-process} was tested with both Lennart Staflin's
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/psgml,PSGML major mode} and James
Clark's @emph{sgml-mode.el} major mode (distributed with GNU Emacs) for
editing XML files. It also works with Tony Graham's
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/xslide,xslide} XSLT editing mode.

To automatically enable the @emph{XSLT-process} minor mode for the above
major modes, add the following lines in your @kbd{~/.emacs} file:

@example
(autoload 'xslt-process-mode "xslt-process" "Emacs XSLT processing" t)
(add-hook 'sgml-mode-hook 'xslt-process-mode)
(add-hook 'xml-mode-hook 'xslt-process-mode)
(add-hook 'xsl-mode-hook 'xslt-process-mode)
@end example

You can also manually switch to this minor mode by typing @kbd{M-x
xslt-process-mode}.

You can check the modeline to see whether Emacs is in the
@emph{XSLT-process} mode. Look for the ``XSLT'' indicator in the
modeline.

@section Setting up the XSLT processor

The @emph{XSLT-process} mode comes by default with two different Java
XSLT processors, Saxon and Xalan. These particular versions of the XSLT
processors were tested and work with the @emph{XSLT-process}
mode. Different versions of the processors may not work with the
@emph{XSLT-process} mode.

You can choose either of the above processors to do the XSLT processing
by selecting one from the ``XSLT'' @result{} ``XSLT Processor''
menu. The default XSLT processor is Saxon.

@section Viewing the results of the XSLT processing

The main functionality of the @emph{XSLT-process} mode is to allow you
to edit an XML document, apply an XSLT stylesheet on the document, and
view the results either in a buffer or in Web browser.

@ifnotinfo
@c @sp 1
@image{apply-xslt}
@end ifnotinfo

To run the XSLT processor and view the results in another Emacs buffer,
you can enter @kbd{C-c C-x v}, while editing the XML
document. Similarly, to view the results in a Web browser, type @kbd{C-c
C-x n}. The Web browser used could be customized as described in
@ref{Customizing the XSLT-process mode}. If you don't like the default
key bindings described above, you can also customize them as described
in the same chapter.

If you choose to view the results in a buffer, they will be shown in the
@code{*xslt results*} buffer. If any message are generated during the
XSLT processing, they are show separately in the @code{*xslt messages*}.

@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Dealing with errors

The @emph{XSLT-process} mode intercepts the error messages generated by
the XML parser or XSLT processor and displays them in compilation
buffer, which quickly allows you to go to the cause of the error.

When you encounter an error, just click using the middle-button
(assuming an X-Windows system) on the error message. Emacs will move the
cursor point at the place that caused the error.

@node  Associating an XSLT stylesheet with an XML document, Changing the XSLT processor, Dealing with errors, Running the XSLT processor
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Associating an XSLT stylesheet with an XML document

The XSLT file that's used to process the file should be specified inside
the XML file using the XML processing instruction @samp{xml-stylesheet},
like this:

@example
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<?xml-stylesheet href="URL/to/XSLT/file" type="text/xsl"?>

...
@end example

You can use any URI understood by your Java system, e.g. file, HTTP or
FTP, to refer to a stylesheet. The XSLT engine will download the
stylesheet from the remote location and make use of it locally. The XSLT
processing code of @emph{XSLT-process} is written such that the
stylesheet is cached, so further invocations won't parse the stylesheet
again, unless the stylesheet is modified.

You can use URLs which are relative to the location of your XML file.
For example if you have an XSLT file @file{page-html.xsl} in the same
directory as the XML file you can simply have inside the XML file the
following processing instruction:

@example
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<?xml-stylesheet href="page-html.xsl" type="text/xsl"?>

...
@end example

Future versions of @emph{XSLT-process} will allow XSLT stylesheets to be
associated to XML documents without having to have an
@samp{xml-stylesheet} processing instruction in the XML document.

@node  Changing the XSLT processor,  , Associating an XSLT stylesheet with an XML document, Running the XSLT processor
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Changing the XSLT processor

If you want to experiment what are the results of applying your
stylesheets using different XSLT processors, you can change the
processor using the menu ``XSLT'' @result{} ``XSLT Processor''. If you
are in the middle of a debugging session, this action will not have
effect until the session is finished.

In certain cases, there are XSLT stylesheets that works only when
processed through a particular XSLT processor. This may happen because
the stylesheet is using XSLT extensions specific to a particular
processor. In this case you can specify the XSLT processor to be used in
the XML source document (see @ref{Known problems and limitations}).

Just add a @emph{Local Variables} section at the end of your XML file
and specify within it what should be the XSLT processor to be invoked
using the @samp{processor} variable. For example, by adding the
following section at the end of your file, you specify @emph{Saxon} to
be used as the XSLT processor, no matter what is the global XSLT
processor setting:

@example
<!--
Local Variables:
processor: Saxon
End:
-->
@end example

In this release, the acceptable values for @samp{processor} are
@samp{Saxon} and @samp{Xalan}, as they are the only supported
processors. By replacing the value of @samp{processor}, you can run any
of the supported processors on your file.

@chapter The XSLT debugger

For relatively simple XSLT stylesheets, understanding how a particular
stylesheet works can be done by repeteadly running the XSLT processor,
and looking at the results. More complex stylesheets however, are
difficult to debug this way, especially when you have lots of XSL
variables and key indices.

@emph{XSLT-process} gives you the ability to run the processor in
debugging mode, which allows you to set breakpoints, run step by step,
view local and global XSLT variables.

@strong{Note:} This release supports debugging only with the Saxon XSLT
processor. Xalan requires line number support for the XML source
document; I have a patch for the 2.1.0 release, but I'm told the Stree
tree model this release uses is going away in the next release. So I
started to work on a patch for the new release which uses the so-called
DTM tree model.

@section Entering the debug mode

While you're editing an XML or XSLT file, the buffer visiting the file
is read-write, allowing you to perform the normal editing operations,
and use the functionality specific to the XML/XSLT/SGML mode you're
using.

The XSLT debugging mode however does not allow you to modify files, and
it binds some of the keys to debugger specific functionality. The XSLT
debugging functionality is a per buffer feature, you can enable and
disable it for each buffer independently.

To toggle the XSLT debugging functionality, type @kbd{C-c C-x d} while
you're in a @emph{XSLT-process} mode buffer. You can also toggle the
debug mode through the menu at ``XSLT'' @result{} ``Toggle debug
mode''. Once you enter the debug mode, you will notice the modeline
indicator changes from ``XSLT'' to ``XSLTd''.

@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Breakpoints

Once you're in the XSLT debugging mode, you can set or delete, enable or
disable breakpoints. During the execution of the XSLT stylesheet, the
XSLT processor will stop when it reaches a breakpoint that is enabled.

The keybindings for breakpoints are:

@itemize @bullet

@item @kbd{b}:
Set a new breakpoint at the line containing point. Doesn't do anything
if a breakpoint is already setup at this location.

The corresponding menu item is disabled if the point is on a line where
a breakpoint is already set.

@item @kbd{d}:
Delete the breakpoint at the line containing point. Nothing happens if
no breakpoint is setup on the line at point.

The corresponding menu item is disabled if the point is on a line where
there is no breakpoint.

@item @kbd{e}:
Enable or disable the breakpoint at the line containing point. If there
is no breakpoint setup at point, nothing happens. If the breakpoint is
enabled, this action will disable it. Similarly, if the breakpoint is
disabled, this action will enable it.

The corresponding menu item is disabled if the point is on a line where
there is no breakpoint.

@end itemize

The enabled and disabled breakpoints are shown with distinctive colors,
so you can easily identify them.

You can setup breakpoints both in the source XML document, and in the
XSLT stylesheet program. Note however that the semantic of a breakpoint
in the source document is very different from a breakpoint in the XSLT
stylesheet. The XSLT processor will stop at a breakpoint in the source
document only when an element on that line is @dfn{selected}, e.g. when
the element becomes the current context node (see the
@uref{http://www.w3c.org/TR/XSLT,XSLT} specification). Compare this with
the XSLT stylesheet, which is essentially a program, and where the stop
at a breakpoint means that the execution of the program reached the
instruction at that line.

@c =========================================================================
@node  Controlling the debugger, The speedbar, Breakpoints, The XSLT debugger
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Controlling the debugger

After you setup the breakpoints where you would like the XSLT processor
to stop, you can start the XSLT processing. You can do this from the
menu at ``XSLT'' @result{} ``Run debugger'', or by typing
@kbd{r}.

@strong{Important:} When starting the debugger, the buffer containing
the XML source document should be current. If a buffer containing an
XSLT document is active instead, the @emph{XSLT-process} mode assumes
this as the source document, and will not be able to find the associated
stylesheet.

The XSLT processor will start and it will continue running in the
background until the execution reaches an enabled breakpoint.

In this moment, Emacs will highlight the line where the XSLT processor
has stopped, and it will wait for an action to be taken. The possible
actions are:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@dfn{Step} (keybinding @kbd{s}): If the XSLT processor stopped when it
was about to enter an XML element, it will enter it and stop the
execution on the first child element, right before entering it.

If the XSLT processor stopped when it was exiting from an XML element,
this action will make the processor exit from the current element, and
stop on the immediatelly following element.

This is equivalent with the @emph{step into} action of debuggers for
traditional programming languages.

@item
@dfn{Next} (keybinding @kbd{n}): If the XSLT processor was about to
enter an XML element, this action will instruct the processor to skip
the element (this includes on of its sub-elements). The processor will
stop when it is about to visit the next sibling XML element. If there is
no such element, the processor will stop when entering the next XML
element which is to be visited.

This is equivalent with the @emph{step over} action of debuggers for
traditional languages.

@item
@dfn{Finish} (keybinding @kbd{f}): Instructs the XSLT processor to
finish the currently executing XSL template, and stop when exiting from
it. If an enabled breakpoint is reached before the end of the template,
the XSLT processor will stop there.

This is equivalent with the @emph{finish} action of traditional
debuggers.

@item
@dfn{Continue} (keybinding @kbd{c}): Instructs the XSLT processor to
continue the processing until the next enabled breakpoint is encountered
or until the XSLT processing finishes.

@item
@dfn{Stop} (keybinding @kbd{a}): In the case of a long processing,
instruct the XSLT processor to abort it and stop immediately. This is
useful for stylesheets that take a long time to complete, and you forgot
to setup the appropriate breakpoints.

The speedbar is a separate Emacs window that allows you to:

@itemize @bullet

@item
View the breakpoints that you've set. The enabled and disabled
breakpoints are shown with distinctive colors, so you can easily

Clicking on a breakpoint entry in the speedbar will move the point to

currently opened within Emacs, it will open and shown in a buffer.

@item
View the stack of source elements that have been selected during the
processing.

Whenever you click with the middle button on such a entry, the point is
positioned in the file and line where the source element starts.

@item
View the stack of XSLT elements that are currently being executed. Each
element that has been entered, but not yet exited is being shown in the
speedbar.

Clicking with the middle button on such a node will position the point
in the file at line where the element starts.

@item
View the local and global variables declared with @code{xsl:variable} or
@code{xsl:param}.

Each entry for a variable has a little icon showing the type of the
variable, its name and value. If images are not supported by your Emacs
(GNU Emacs 20.x and lower), a text indication of the type is shown
instead. Below are all the possible XSLT types and how they are

The following is a list of differences between GNU Emacs and XEmacs. As
the @emph{XSLT-process} mode is developed under XEmacs, I would
appreciate your support in making the GNU Emacs version behave closer to
the XEmacs one.

@itemize @bullet

@item
Under GNU Emacs, the keybinding of a command does not appear in the menu
item as they appear under XEmacs.

@item
The @emph{Local Variables} section that specifies which XSLT processor
to be used has to be placed in the XML source document, instead of the
XSLT stylesheet which processes the XML document.

This will change when @emph{XSLT-process} has support for registering
XSLT stylesheets with it, instead of having them associated with the XML
source document through a @samp{xml-stylesheet} processing instruction
(see @ref{Future enhancements}).

@chapter Future enhancements

This is a list of features planned for future releases. The list doesn't
specify any particular order in the priority, and the features may or
may not be implemented.

@itemize @bullet

@item
Add ability to evaluate XPath expressions. The context node could be
either the top node of the XML document or it can be specified by
putting the point on it.

This would be a very useful tool for novice XSLT users to learn XPath
(and Emacs ;-).

@item
Maintain a list of XSLT stylesheets, managed by the user, and specify
the stylesheet to be applied on an XML document from this list. This
eliminates the need to have an @samp{xml-stylesheet} processing
instruction in the XML document, that specifies the XSLT stylesheet to
be applied.

@item
Ability to pass parameters to the XSLT processor. This could be done at
multiple levels:

@itemize @bullet

@item @emph{globally}:
these are parameters that are specified to all the stylesheets, in
addition to any other parameters. They could be specified through the
customization menu.

@item @emph{per XSLT stylesheet}:
these are parameters specified to a given XSLT stylesheet, and they are
passed only to this stylesheet.

@item @emph{per XML document}:
these are parameters specified for a given XML document.

@end itemize

The per XML document or XSLT stylesheet parameters can be specified
using the @emph{Local Variables} section in file, the same way as the
XSLT processor could be temporarily changed per file.


@item
Add the ability to process and debug JSPs and Cocoon's XSP. This would
be very useful and would improve the overall edit-run-debug process for
these applications substantially.

@item
Add the ability to go both forward and backwards in time during
debugging. This would be a nice feature to have for the cases where
reaching the point of interest in the stylesheet takes a lot of time,
and the pressing the wrong key makes you miss it.

@item
Integrate the XSLT debugger with the JDE debugger, to give the ability
to debug extension functions. This should be possible, but is a lot more
complex as it requires the Java debugger to attach to the XSLT
processor, and do some magic to get to the right context.

@chapter Changes

These are the changes since the 1.2.2 release:

@itemize @bullet

@item
The functionality has been greatly improved, support for debugging and
error reporting has been added.

@item
The code has been completely overhauled. A new dedicated Java command
line tool replaces the more generic BSH process. This command line tool
is the low level interface used by the @emph{XSLT-process} to perform
its functionality, and interacts directly with the XSLT processors.

@item
The project has been moved to Sourceforge, including CVS source tree and
previous releases of the code, and is open to public
participation. Please register on the public mailing list to participate
in discussions related to @emph{XSLT-process}.

@end itemize

@sp 1

These are the changes since the 1.2 release:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Fixed problem in accessing stylesheets referred by @kbd{file:} URIs on
Windows. Reported by @email{kessler@@balcab.ch, Nicolas Kessler}.

@end itemize

@sp 1

This is the list of changes since the 1.1 release.

@itemize @bullet

@item
Added support for the TrAX interface, part of the JAXP API, thanks to
@email{a.erskine@@cs.ucl.ac.uk, Allan Erskine}. Currently Saxon 6.2 and
Xalan2 have been tested. The TrAX interface caches the XSLT stylesheets
in the processor driver in a compiled form, so the speed of the
processing is increased.

@item
The mode is now running with GNU Emacs on Windows NT/2000, thanks to
@email{a.erskine@@cs.ucl.ac.uk, Allan Erskine} for figuring out
the issues.

@item
Changed again the keyboard binding to @kbd{C-c C-x C-v}, as @kbd{C-M-x}
doesn't work on Windows systems.

@item
The documentation has been reorganized a little bit to be more logical.

@end itemize

@sp 1

This is the list of changes since the 1.0 release.

@itemize @bullet

@item
The @samp{xslt-process-additional-classpath} customization variable has
been introduced. Setup this variable with any additional Java classpath
components you want to be passed to the BeanShell when is first
invoked. If you already started a BeanShell, you need to kill the
corresponding buffer (named @samp{*bsh*}) and restart it by invoking
@emph{XSLT-process} on a buffer. (Suggestion from
@email{tvraman@@almaden.ibm.com, T. V. Raman}.)

@item
Allow for passing the user agent to the Cocoon processor so that
multiple browser types can be simulated. This works with a patch I
submitted against Cocoon 1.8-dev; it was incorporated and should be
available in the 1.8.1 release. If you need the patch before this
release, feel free to contact me, I'll gladly send it to you.

@item
The way the error messages are displayed has changed, now error messages
messages encountered during the JVM startup process also go in the
@samp{*xslt-output*} buffer.

@item
The default keybinding has been changed to @kbd{C-M-x} instead of
@kbd{C-c x}, to conform to the (X)Emacs keybinding standards.
